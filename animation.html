                    This is a little personal project of mine that is based off 
                    a story premise I've been working on, testing my knowledge 
                    and skills aswell as giving me something fun to do.

                    With a background in cognitive science, his expertise in 
                    sound engineering, and any spare pieces of electrical tat 
                    found in his electonics repair shop, Dr. Ivan Grokinski (Dr. Grok) 
                    builds 'The Dream Catcher', a super computer that attempts 
                    to emulate the human brain using only specific sound frequencies 
                    to traffic information between mind and machine. Using himself as 
                    the only test subject, Dr. Grok slowly begins to succumb to 
                    the pleasentries of his own creation. As he becomes more 
                    and more secluded away from reality, will he ever break free 
                    from his own dream?
