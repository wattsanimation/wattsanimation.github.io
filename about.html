                    I'm Ant, and I animate. I have a wide range of 
                    knowledge of the animation process and production, 
                    aswell as the software that is involved. I'm always 
                    exploring new software and devolping new techniques 
                    to add to my skillset while imporving my productivity.

                <h1>About this Website</h1>
                <h4>
                    Initially I just wanted to publish a new portfolio
                    site, but my curiosity grew, and with some guidence on
                    on the side I eventually started to learn and develop my own 
                    site in HTML/CSS. 
                </h4>                    
                <h4>
                    Now this site has also become an experiment 
                    in self sustainabilty and maintenece, the idea being that 
                    eventually this will be my main identity on the net, 
                    while keeping the few outlets of social media that I have at 
                    a safe social distance. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    It's still a work in progress mind you as 
                    there's more artwork and animation projects that I need to upload, 
                    I also intend to add some form of a blog/journal to record 
                    my process and any additional thoughts.
